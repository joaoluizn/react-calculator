# React Calculator

This is my React Calculator implementation for FreeCodeCamp Project #14. The first version was built on this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/joaoluizn/pen/GwMMrq).

## Dependencies:
- Node Stable

## Running the Project

Just run the following:
```bash
$ npm start
```

Voil√°! It is now running on port 3000.

# Known Issues:
- Bigger number are going out of display!
